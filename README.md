# kabob-query

A canned query interface for the [Knowledgebase of Biomedicine][kb-gh], the
goal of this package is to provide an interface that might be used by external
tools and systems to query the Knowledgebase.  To this end it currently
provides a trivial command-line interface; we anticipate that this will evolve
into something more dynamic (read: web service).
